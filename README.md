# HR-Attrition

This is a model that helps HR predicts the staff turnover (staff leaving or not)


First, we stated by understanding data and describing its features 
with pandas.describe and sns.heatmap we were able to see the relations between diffrent features.

Then, we were able to create our model after doing some preprocessing for our data (ordinal encoding)
and using train_test_split.

we used a random forset as our classifier and we evaluated it's performance by calculating the accuracy metric.
finally we deployed the model into a small web app thanks to flask and pickle.
